# FromSoft Mod Manager

**FromSoft Mod Manager** is a free, all-in-one desktop app for playing
FromSoftware games in co-op with your friends. Instead of manually
downloading mods, editing config files, and juggling launchers — just
click install, set a password, and play.

## What it does

- **Installs co-op mods for you** — one click to download and set up
  Seamless Co-op for Elden Ring, Dark Souls III, Dark Souls Remastered,
  Armored Core 6, and Elden Ring Nightreign
- **Keeps mods updated** — checks Nexus Mods for new versions and
  updates in-place, preserving your settings
- **Manages your saves** — back up, restore, and transfer save files
  between solo and co-op without risk
- **Launches games correctly** — uses Mod Engine 3 under the hood so
  all your mods load properly every time
- **Supports additional mods** — browse trending mods on Nexus, or
  add your own from a URL or local file

## Who it's for

Anyone who wants to play FromSoft games in co-op without dealing with
the technical setup. Whether you're setting up for the first time or
switching from another tool like Mod Engine Manager, the app detects
your existing configuration and gets you playing fast.

## How it works

1. Run the installer — no admin rights needed
2. The app finds your Steam games automatically
3. Connect your Nexus Mods account (one-click browser auth)
4. Install the co-op mod and hit Play

Everything stays organized in one place — mod settings, save files,
game launching, and updates.
